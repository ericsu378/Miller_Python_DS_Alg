# Repo Summary
'Miller_Python_DS_Alg' is the repo I am using to work through examples and exercises within: 
[Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).

Using this book to brush up on core CS concepts, and to gain a better understanding of the Python language. 

With that, hope you enjoy~ and comments are greatly appreciated :)

# Repo Structure
Each chapter will be seperated in its own folder. Within each chapter folder, I will try my best to make it easily navigable, but as concepts may be deeply intertwined, there may be times where it might not be apparent. 
Once I finish the book, I plan to do another pass over the code for corrections / cleaning / refactoring,  and provide additional readme's per folder, along with markdown notes to aid in navigation.
